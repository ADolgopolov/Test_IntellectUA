I love my zoo!
I have a zoo
There is a big brown bear, an orange monkey, a small purple octopus and a little red fox in my zoo
There are three grey cats, eight pink rabbits and two black and white zebras in my zoo, too
There isn't a hippo or a lion in my zoo
I see my animals every day
I love my zoo!
